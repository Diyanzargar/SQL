# Task 7: Creating and Using Views

## 📋 Project Overview

Master SQL views through 15+ practical examples using the house sales database. Learn to create reusable SQL logic, implement data security, and simplify complex queries.

**Database:** Springfield City House Sales (from Task 5)  
**Focus:** Views for abstraction and security  
**Complexity:** Simple → Intermediate → Advanced

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this task, you will:

✅ Understand what views are and why they're useful  
✅ Create simple and complex views  
✅ Use views for data security and privacy  
✅ Implement updatable views  
✅ Apply views for business logic abstraction  
✅ Manage views (create, query, drop, replace)  
✅ Answer all interview questions confidently

## 🗄️ Database Schema (from Task 5)

This task uses the same house sales database:

**5 Tables:**
1. **Neighborhoods** - Area information and ratings
2. **Agents** - Real estate agents
3. **Buyers** - Property buyers
4. **PropertyListings** - Houses for sale
5. **Sales** - Transaction records


---

## 📚 What's Covered

###Basic Views
**Examples:**
- Available properties (unsold only)
- Luxury properties (>$450k)
- Budget properties (<$350k)

**Learn:** Simple view creation and filtering

---

###Views with Joins
**Examples:**
- Property details with neighborhood info
- Complete sales information (4-table join)
- Agent listings with status

**Learn:** Combining multiple tables in views

---

###Views with Aggregations 
**Examples:**
- Neighborhood statistics
- Agent performance metrics
- Buyer activity summary

**Learn:** Aggregate functions in views

---

###Security & Data Abstraction
**Examples:**
- Public property listings (hide sensitive data)
- Buyer contact info (hide budgets)
- Recent sales report (last 90 days only)

**Learn:** Using views for data security

---

###Advanced Views (Complex Logic)
**3 Examples:**
- Property value analysis (with subqueries)
- Investment opportunities (complex ratings)
- Market trends (price comparisons)

**Learn:** Complex calculations and business logic

---

###Updatable Views (Advanced)
**2 Examples:**
- Editable properties view
- Safe neighborhood properties (with filters)

**Learn:** When and how views can be updated

---

###View Management
- How to query views
- How to drop views
- How to replace/update views
- Best practices and tips

---

## 💡 Key Concepts

### What is a View?
A **virtual table** created from a SQL query. It doesn't store data but shows data from underlying tables.


### Types of Views Created:

**1. Simple Views:**
- Single table
- Basic filtering
- Quick access to common data

**2. Complex Views:**
- Multiple table joins
- Aggregations and calculations
- Business logic encapsulation

**3. Security Views:**
- Hide sensitive columns
- Filter rows based on permissions
- Present different data to different users

**4. Updatable Views:**
- Allow INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
- Must meet specific criteria
- Single table, no aggregations

---

## 🛡️ Security Benefits of Views

### 1. Hide Sensitive Columns
```sql
-- Base table has: buyer_id, name, email, budget
-- View shows only: name, email
CREATE VIEW BuyerContactInfo AS
SELECT buyer_name, email FROM Buyers;
```

### 2. Filter Rows
```sql
-- Show only safe neighborhood properties
CREATE VIEW SafeProperties AS
SELECT * FROM PropertyListings
WHERE neighborhood_id IN (
    SELECT neighborhood_id FROM Neighborhoods WHERE safety_rating >= 8
);
```

### 3. Mask Financial Data
```sql
-- Show budget ranges instead of exact amounts
CREATE VIEW BuyerBudgetRange AS
SELECT buyer_name,
    CASE 
        WHEN budget < 300000 THEN 'Under 300K'
        ELSE 'Above 300K'
    END AS budget_range
FROM Buyers;
```

## ⚡ Performance Considerations

### Views DON'T:
❌ Store data (virtual table)  
❌ Improve query speed (query runs each time)  
❌ Have their own indexes (in most databases)  

### Views DO:
✅ Simplify complex queries  
✅ Provide consistent logic  
✅ Enhance security  
✅ Make code reusable  

### Performance Tips:
- Index underlying tables properly
- Keep view logic simple when possible
- Consider materialized views for complex aggregations
- Avoid views on top of views (nested views)

---

## 📊 When to Use Views

### ✅ Use Views For:
- Frequently used complex queries
- Data security and privacy
- Hiding implementation details
- Consistent business logic
- Different data presentations
- Backward compatibility

### ❌ Don't Use Views For:
- One-time queries (just use SELECT)
- Very complex joins (performance issues)
- When you need to update data frequently
- Real-time aggregations (use materialized views)

## 🎯 View vs Table vs Materialized View

| Feature | View | Table | Materialized View |
|---------|------|-------|-------------------|
| **Stores Data** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Query Speed** | Runs each time | Fast | Very fast |
| **Disk Space** | None | Uses space | Uses space |
| **Data Freshness** | Always current | Current | Needs refresh |
| **Updatable** | Limited | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Use Case** | Simplify queries | Store data | Reports/analytics |

---

## ✅ Task Requirements Met

| Requirement | Status | Implementation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| Create views with complex SELECT | ✅ |
| Use for abstraction | ✅ |
| Use for security | ✅ |
| Reusable SQL logic | ✅ |
| View definitions | ✅ |

---


### DON'T:
❌ Create views on top of views (nested)  
❌ Use views for one-time queries  
❌ Ignore performance implications  
❌ Forget to drop unused views  
❌ Over-complicate view logic  
❌ Assume all views are updatable

## 📝 View Management Commands

### Create a View:
```sql
CREATE VIEW ViewName AS SELECT ...;
```

### Query a View:
```sql
SELECT * FROM ViewName WHERE condition;
```

### Drop a View:
```sql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS ViewName;
```

### Replace a View (MySQL/PostgreSQL):
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW ViewName AS SELECT ...;
```

### Replace a View (SQLite):
```sql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS ViewName;
CREATE VIEW ViewName AS SELECT ...;
```
