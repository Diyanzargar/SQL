## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Tables (5):

1. **Neighborhoods** - Areas/districts with ratings and pricing
2. **Agents** - Real estate agents who list properties
3. **Buyers** - Customers looking to purchase homes
4. **PropertyListings** - Houses available for sale
5. **Sales** - Completed transactions


### Key Features:
- ✅ Realistic real estate data
- ✅ Some properties sold, some still on market
- ✅ Some buyers haven't purchased yet
- ✅ Some properties lack neighborhood/agent (for NULL handling)
- ✅ Perfect for demonstrating all join types
