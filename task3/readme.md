🎓 SQL Developer Internship - Task 3: SELECT Queries

🎯 Project Overview
This repository contains the complete submission for Task 3 of the SQL Developer Internship program. The task focuses on mastering basic SQL SELECT queries to extract and manipulate data from a university management database.
Completion Date: October 23, 2025
Database: UniversityManagementSystem

🎯 Task Objective
Extract data from one or more tables using fundamental SQL SELECT operations.
The goal is to develop a clear understanding of:

How to retrieve data efficiently
Applying various filtering techniques
Sorting and limiting results
Pattern matching and range queries
Writing clean, readable SQL code


🔧 Concepts Covered
This task demonstrates mastery of the following SQL concepts:
✅ Core SELECT Operations

SELECT * - Retrieving all columns
SELECT column1, column2 - Specific column projection
Basic data retrieval from single tables

✅ Filtering Data (WHERE Clause)

Comparison operators: =, >, <, >=, <=, <>
Boolean conditions
Multiple conditions with AND / OR
IN operator for multiple values
LIKE operator for pattern matching
BETWEEN operator for range queries

✅ Data Organization

ORDER BY - Sorting (ASC/DESC)
LIMIT - Restricting output rows
DISTINCT - Removing duplicates

✅ Query Enhancement

Column aliases (AS)
Table aliases
Calculated columns
Multi-column sorting

✅ Advanced Combinations

Complex WHERE clauses
Multiple sorting criteria
Filtered and sorted results
Business logic queries

📚 Learning Outcomes
After completing this task, I learned:

✅ Write efficient SELECT queries to retrieve specific data
✅ Apply various filtering techniques using WHERE clause
✅ Use pattern matching with LIKE operator
✅ Filter data within ranges using BETWEEN
✅ Combine multiple conditions with AND/OR logic
✅ Sort results in ascending or descending order
✅ Limit query output for performance and pagination
✅ Remove duplicate values using DISTINCT
✅ Create readable queries with aliases
✅ Write complex queries combining multiple concepts



💡 Best Practices Demonstrated

Always specify columns instead of using SELECT *
Use meaningful aliases for better readability
Add comments to explain complex logic
Format queries with proper indentation
Test incrementally when building complex queries
Consider performance when writing queries
Use LIMIT when testing on large datasets
Order filtering before sorting for efficiency
