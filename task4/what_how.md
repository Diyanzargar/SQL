## üìä Summary Statistics

- **Tables Analyzed:** 7 (DEPARTMENTS, PROFESSORS, STUDENTS, COURSES, ENROLLMENTS, ASSIGNMENTS, GRADES)
- **Aggregate Functions Used:** 6 (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, COUNT DISTINCT)
- **Key Clauses Applied:** GROUP BY, HAVING, WHERE, ORDER BY, ROUND


---

## üéØ Key Concepts Mastered

### Aggregate Functions
1. **COUNT(*)** - Count all rows including NULLs
2. **COUNT(column)** - Count non-NULL values only
3. **COUNT(DISTINCT column)** - Count unique values
4. **SUM()** - Add up numeric values
5. **AVG()** - Calculate arithmetic mean
6. **MIN()** - Find minimum value
7. **MAX()** - Find maximum value
8. **ROUND()** - Format decimal numbers

### Grouping and Filtering
9. **GROUP BY** - Categorize data into groups
10. **HAVING** - Filter groups after aggregation
11. **WHERE** - Filter rows before aggregation
12. **Multiple column grouping** - Complex categorization

### Analysis Techniques
13. NULL handling in aggregates
14. Combining aggregates with calculations
15. Hierarchical grouping
16. Conditional aggregation with CASE
17. Statistical summaries
