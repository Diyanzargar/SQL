## üéØ Project Overview

This repository contains the complete submission for **Task 4** of the SQL Developer Internship program. The task focuses on mastering aggregate functions and data grouping to perform statistical analysis and generate business intelligence reports.

**Completion Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Database:** UniversityManagementSystem  
**Concepts:** Aggregation, Grouping, Statistical Analysis

---

## üéØ Task Objective

**Use aggregate functions and grouping to summarize and analyze tabular data.**

The goal is to develop expertise in:
- Applying aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX)
- Grouping data by single and multiple columns
- Filtering groups with HAVING clause
- Understanding WHERE vs HAVING
- Counting distinct values
- Formatting results with ROUND()
- Creating business intelligence queries

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

The **UniversityManagementSystem** database contains 7 interconnected tables:

### Tables Overview

| Table | Purpose | Aggregate Use Cases |
|-------|---------|---------------------|
| **DEPARTMENTS** | Academic departments | Budget totals, average budgets |
| **PROFESSORS** | Faculty information | Salary statistics, headcount by dept |
| **STUDENTS** | Student records | Student counts, age averages |
| **COURSES** | Course catalog | Credit totals, course counts by semester |
| **ENROLLMENTS** | Student enrollments | Enrollment trends, status distribution |
| **ASSIGNMENTS** | Course assignments | Point averages, assignment type counts |
| **GRADES** | Assignment grades | Performance averages, submission counts |

## üîß Concepts Covered

This task demonstrates mastery of the following SQL concepts:

### ‚úÖ Aggregate Functions
- **COUNT(*)** - Count all rows (includes NULLs)
- **COUNT(column)** - Count non-NULL values
- **COUNT(DISTINCT column)** - Count unique values
- **SUM()** - Total of numeric values
- **AVG()** - Calculate arithmetic mean
- **MIN()** - Find minimum value
- **MAX()** - Find maximum value

### ‚úÖ Mathematical Functions
- **ROUND(value, decimals)** - Format numeric results
- Calculations within aggregates
- Multiple aggregates in single query

### ‚úÖ Grouping Data
- **GROUP BY** - Single column grouping
- **GROUP BY** - Multiple column grouping
- Hierarchical grouping patterns
- GROUP BY with ORDER BY for ranking

### ‚úÖ Filtering
- **WHERE** - Filter rows before grouping
- **HAVING** - Filter groups after aggregation
- **WHERE + HAVING** - Combined filtering
- Comparison of filtering approaches

### ‚úÖ Advanced Techniques
- Conditional aggregation with CASE
- Text column aggregation
- Subqueries with aggregates
- Complex business intelligence queries
- NULL handling in aggregates
